on Nashorn, we provide this via MersenneTwisterFast.  in the browser,
we delegate to Math.random(), for speed.  we could swap in a JS
implementation of the Mersenne Twister (code for it is googlable),
but I fear (though have not measured) the performance impact --ST

module.exports =
  Random ? {
    nextInt:    (limit) -> Math.floor(Math.random() * limit)
    nextLong:   (limit) -> @nextInt(limit)
    nextDouble:         -> Math.random()
    setSeed:    (seed)  -> return # No-op!
  }
